🌟 Internship Project: Influencer Popularity Predictor

As part of my internship, I designed and developed a Machine Learning–driven web application titled Influencer Popularity Predictor, aimed at evaluating and forecasting the popularity levels of K-Pop influencers based on measurable engagement metrics.

The project integrates data science, visualization, and deployment to provide data-driven insights that can assist brands and marketing teams in identifying high-impact influencers.

🔍 Project Overview

Objective: To build a predictive model capable of classifying influencers into High, Medium, or Low popularity categories based on features such as subscriber count, total views, and video uploads.

Feature Engineering & Visualization: Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize feature distributions, correlations, and key influencers of engagement levels.

Dashboard Insights: Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize influencer metrics, popularity trends, and feature importance for improved interpretability.

Web Deployment: Integrated the trained model into a Flask web application and deployed it on PythonAnywhere for public accessibility.
